# Enhancing and Adapting in the Clinic: Test-time Adaptation for Medical Image Enhancement
We propose an algorithm for test-time adaptive medical image enhancement (TAME), which adapts and optimizes enhancement models using test data in the inference phase.

## Trained model's weight

**Note:** If you want to use TAME in your own dataset, please re-train a new model with your own data, because it is a method based on domain adaptation, which means it needs target data (without ground truth) in the training phase.

For the model of TAME 'Enhancing and Adapting in the Clinic: Test-time Adaptation for Medical Image Enhancement' please download the pretrained model and place the document based on the following table:
